If I do anything with Minimal.db, it probably ends up here, useful or not.

# Stuff
- **minimal_bootstrap.moo**: An opinionated server start script to set up a working Minimal.db environment. Includes a start script handler and a mildly-enhanced eval verb.
- **edit.moo**: A quick and dirty `@edit` verb that invokes the old-school LambdaMOO-style local editor and, if a verb doesn't exist, adds it.
- **fulldump.moo**: A verb to dump every object in the database, showing its flags, verbs, and properties. It's not a pretty tree, it's not well organized, but it did help verify that I swapped #2 and #3 without forgetting anything.
